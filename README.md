# Liver Tumor Segmentation using U-Net and Attention U-Net

## Overview

This project presents a deep learning approach to liver tumor segmentation from CT scans, using U-Net and Attention U-Net architectures. 
It was done by Ahmed El Bajdali, Marouane EL Ouarraq, and Cyrielle Th√©obald.

## Results

- Segmentation performance is visualized for selected CT slices.
- High Dice scores and IoU confirm effective tumor segmentation.
- Visual results show accurate delineation of liver tumors.

## Key Features

- **Data Handling**: Uses HDF5 format for fast access and reuse.
- **Visualization**: Slice-by-slice inspection of scans and segmentations.
- **Architectures**: Implements both U-Net and Attention U-Net.
- **Metrics**: Tracks multiple evaluation criteria (Dice, IoU, etc.).
